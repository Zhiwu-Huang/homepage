      <h2>Short Bio...</h2>
	    
	<p> Zhiwu Huang is a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich, working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TwMib_QAAAAJ&hl=en">Luc Van Gool</a>. He pursued his Ph.D. degree at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vkzd7MIAAAAJ&hl=en">Shiguang Shan</a>. He obtained his bachelor and master degrees from Huaqiao University and Xiamen University respectively. His research studies human-inspired visual intelligence to understand the world through videos, with applications to deepfakes generation & detection, perceptual quality enhancing, affective & behavioural computing, as well as scalable autonomous driving. He serves as reviewers for major conferences and journals in computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. He has also led the organization of multiple video understanding workshops in conjunction with CVPR, ICCV and ECCV.
