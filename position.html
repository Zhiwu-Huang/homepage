    <h2> My SMU research team is opening multiple new PhD positions. </h2> 
	  
    <h3> Research Description </h3>
    
        Videos are ideally suited for teaching machines lots of knowledge about the world because they implicitly encode the physical constraints that define it. However, existing computer vision models generally approach the video understanding problems with extremely expensive expert knowledge in terms of data pre-processing, data annotation, feature engineering, network design and loss function exploitation. Our research aims at addressing some of these challenges for both low-level and high-level video understanding problems. The PhD student tasks will involve developing novel ideas in the cutting-â€‹edge research, as well as conducting data collection for their evaluation. 

    <h3> Your Profile </h3>
    
	<li> Bachelor degree or Master degree (if applicable) in computer science, electrical engineering, or applied mathematics </li>
    	<li> High enthusiasm for leading-edge research, team spirit, and capability of independent problem-solving </li>
        <li> Rich programming knowledge and experience with Python / MATLAB / C++ </li>
        <li> Fluent written and spoken English is a must </li>
        <li> Good knowledge and experience in one or more of the following is a plus: computer vision, deep learning, manifold learning, generative modeling, GPU programming </li>

    <h3> Funding Opportunities </h3>
	  
	  SMU generally offers very competitive scholarships and financial aid to PhD candidates. For more details, please refer to the related <a href="https://sis.smu.edu.sg/programmes/PhD/admission-fees-scholarships"> information </a>.

    <h3> How To Apply </h3>
	  
	  For applications, please first send an email to: zhiwu.huang@vision.ee.ethz.ch, including: CV, transcript of courses taken and exam results, and qualifications in reading, speaking, and writing English, and two referee reports (referees are expected to submit the completed referee form directly to us). After the shortlisting and interview process, we will consider to create an initial offer, and move forward to the <a href="https://sis.smu.edu.sg/programmes/PhD/online-application "> online application </a>.
