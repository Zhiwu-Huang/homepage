    <h2> My research team is opening new PhD positions in Computer Vision. </h2> 
	  
    <h3> Research Description </h3>
    
	Visual information is ideally suited for teaching machines with lots of knowledge about the world, because it implicitly encodes the physical constraints that define it. However, existing computer vision models generally approach the visual computing problems with extremely expensive expert knowledge in terms of data pre-processing, manual labeling, feature engineering, neuron design and task assignment. Our research aims at addressing these challenges for both low-level and high-level visual understanding and communication problems such as visual fake, affect and behavior computing. In particular, our research studies automated learning on visual data, label, feature, neuron and task, which aims for making machines to learn the visual world, all by themselves. The PhD student tasks will involve developing novel ideas in the cutting- edge research, as well as conducting data collection for their evaluation.

    <h3> Your Profile </h3>
    
	<li> Bachelor degree or Master degree (if applicable) in computer science, electrical engineering, or applied mathematics </li>
    	<li> High enthusiasm for leading-edge research, team spirit, and capability of independent problem-solving </li>
        <li> Rich programming knowledge and experience with Python / MATLAB / C++ </li>
        <li> Fluent written and spoken English is a must.  </li>
	<!--Note that applicants whose medium of instruction for their Bachelor degree is not in English are required to submit TOEFL/IELTS (international test) scores.-->
        <li> Good knowledge and experience in one or more of the following is a plus: computer vision, deep learning, manifold learning, generative modeling, GPU programming </li>

    <h3> Funding Opportunities </h3>
	  
	  We generally offers competitive scholarships or studentships to PhD candidates. <!--Full scholarships are available for the opening positions. For more details, please refer to the related <a href="https://sis.smu.edu.sg/programmes/PhD/admission-fees-scholarships">information</a>.-->

    <h3> How To Apply </h3>
	  
	  <!--For applications, please first send an email to: zhiwu.huang@vision.ee.ethz.ch, including: CV, transcript of bachelor and master courses, a brief statement of research interests, qualifications in reading, speaking, and writing English, and two referee reports (referees are expected to submit the completed referee form directly to us).
